## Asking Questions and Getting Help

There are 9 staff members (instructor, TAs, and tutors) to help with your
learning, and a few different ways to get in touch and ask for help.

  - **In-person only office hours**: Tuesday 9:45am-11:15am, CSE 4204
  - **Remote only office hours**: Thursday 9:45am-11:15am, [https://ucsd.zoom.us/my/gregmiranda](https://ucsd.zoom.us/my/gregmiranda)

Do NOT use the Canvas mailing feature to contact us. We will NOT respond to those
messages. If you need to send a private message to the instructor, you can use his ucsd email
address (but any course related questions should ideally be through Piazza).

## Message Board Questions

You can post questions on our Piazza message board at any time:
[https://piazza.com/ucsd/spring2022/cse12_sp22_c00/home](https://piazza.com/ucsd/spring2022/cse12_sp22_c00/home)

The message board is a good place for questions about something that was
confusing in class, in videos, in the book, or generally about course content.
It's not always the best place for help with programming details on your
assignments (remote or in-person lab hours are better for that). If you do post
for help with a programming assignment, we ask that you use good judgment in how
much code you share – sharing too much as part of your question could harm
others' learning if they aren't expecting to see parts of a solution. 

Feel free to engage with your classmates and help answer their questions. Always
be polite and assume the best intentions. Always assume that the person you're
talking to is asking an honest question, and don't assume they “should know”
something; if they seem to not know something from the course, reminding them
with a link to where it was taught can be useful (instead of saying something
like “that was already covered”). Try to guide your classmates to useful
conclusions on their own rather than solving their problems for them. Using
emoji can always help with a positive and friendly vibe 🙂

During the times where we have take-home programming exams, Piazza will not
allow posting public to the class.

## FAQs

**Do I have to participate if I'm on the waitlist?**

Yes, you're responsible for everything as if you're a normally-enrolled student
while you're on the waitlist, including any submission deadlines, and your work
will be graded as usual.

**I have a question about enrollments and the waitlist.**

Please contact [CSE student
affairs](https://cse.ucsd.edu/undergraduate/undergraduate/advising/cse-student-affairs-office-hours),
who can give the best advice and information about the enrollment process. They
are friendly and helpful and know much more about timing and any updates you
will see through the registration system.

There is some useful advice at [Enrolling in CSE
Courses](https://cse.ucsd.edu/undergraduate/courses/enrolling-cse-courses) that
likely summarizes a lot of what they would tell you to get you started.

**Will the course be in-person or remote? Is attendance required?**

The content of the course is primarily delivered through an online textbook and
through pre-recorded videos from the instructors. The synchronous sessions are
for problem-solving with your classmates and Q&A with the instructional team.
In each session, you will work in pairs or small groups on problems that we
provide and we will go over them as a group.

Attendance is not required, but is highly recommended. Studies (by UCSD faculty)
have shown that attendance and participation in lecture leads to better
student performance and higher grades.

All of the exams, including the **final exam**, will have an asynchronous format. 
Students will not be required to take the final exam during the scheduled block, 
and there will be some flexibility on when it needs to be completed on the day of 
the exam (but not necessarily flexibility to take it on other days). 

**What's the course material like?**

You can see a [previous version of the
course](https://ucsd-cse12-sp21.github.io/), which will give you a sense. This
offering will not be identical, but will be similar.

There is no required textbook for you to purchase for the course. The course uses a combination of online resources and notes from the instructors.

**Can I audit the course?**

You can use all the public resources on this website, and if you're a UCSD
community member, you can view all the podcasts for the problem sessions at
[https://podcast.ucsd.edu/](https://podcast.ucsd.edu/). Beyond that we don't
have any formalized support for auditing the course.


**What if I have enrolled in CSE12 but won't be able to be in La Jolla for most
or all of Spring 2022?**

If the attendance policy above doesn't address your situation, please contact
`g2miranda@eng.ucsd.edu`.

**Do we need a clicker for this class?**

No.

**Where are the icons from?**
